When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work
    local in the following circumstances:
        1. When I'm collaborating with others on the project.
        2. When I want to publish the work for others to read/modify/copy.
        3. When I want to edit the repository from different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
    automatically stay up-to-date with my repository to make sure:
    	1. That I pull only when the commits made can be compiled and run.
    	2. So that I can pull commits in different branches if I want.
    	3. I don't have unwanted changes made to my project (from commits made
        by others).

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork
    	Copy a repository to your Github profile (clone remains on github's
        servers). The forked repo links back to the original repository and the
        original repository's fork score increases.
    Clone
    	Copy a repository on your local machine. Clones can be made from 
        remotes or local repos.
    Branches
    	A branch is when you give a new label to certain commits. You can then
        grow the branch into a different version of your project without 
        affecting the master branch and keeping these commits reachable.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefits of having a copy of the last known state of a remote stored
    locally:
        1. We're up to date with the remote, and so we won't make redundant
        changes.
        2. We can avoid making conflicting changes.
        3. We can merge out-of-sync remotes.
        4. We're up to date with the collaborative project we're working on.
